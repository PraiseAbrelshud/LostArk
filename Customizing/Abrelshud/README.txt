1. First of all, the Abrelshud/Brelshaza customization was originally designed by the user 나만딜함 at the Lost Ark Inven. Please give a random applause for 나만딜함 for her/his creativity and all the time and effort she/he had spent for this customization. The link for the original post is at https://www.inven.co.kr/board/lostark/4823/98031.

2. However, 나만딜함's rendition of the Abrelshud/Brelshaza customization is not compatible with the NA/EU/SA version of Lost Ark. Hence, the NA/EU/SA-compatible version of the Abrelshud/Brelshaza customization was later recreated by the user PraiseAbrelshud (NA East-Aldebaran) primarily based on 나만딜함's rendition. PraiseAbrelshud's rendition of the customization first appeared at r/lostarkgame on July 3, 2022, and the original post is available at https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/comments/vqrryw/well_i_guess_ill_just_join_the_phantom_legion_who.

3. You can apply the customization by copying the customization file (.cus) to your EFGAME\Customizing directory. The link to the Customizing directory for Lost Ark in the NA/EU/SA region is as follows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lost Ark\EFGame\Customizing.

4. After launching Lost Ark from Steam, you will be able to see that the customization slot is now activated and that you can load the Abrelshud/Brelshaza customization.

5. Enjoy Lost Ark!
